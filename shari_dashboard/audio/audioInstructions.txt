To use this aduio test you must have installed local web server, e.g. apache2, lighttpd and php.


Below is a description of how to perform a local test of our level measurements audio that goes out to the SVXReflector network.
For this purpose, the ALSA Loop i virtual carat will be used audio from svxlink will be able to be recorded via such a virtual card and listened to on a special page in the dashboard where we will see the level indicator audio on the dB scale.
==========================================================================
Loading the ALSA Loopback Virtual Sound Card:
===================================================================

Add to the /etc/modules file
   snd_aloop
Add the lines to the beginning of the file in /etc/modprobe.d/alsa.conf
   options snd_aloop index=1
Reboot your computer You can check if the Loopback tab is visible with the command:

cat /proc/asound/cards

It will be visible in the Loopback directory under the number:

  0 [Set				 ]: USB-Audio - C-Media USB Headphone Set
                      C-Media USB Headphone Set at usb-3f980000.usb-1.5, full speed
  1 [Loopback 	]: Loopback - Loopback
                       Loopback 1

Copy the SimplexLogicTS.tcl file to /usr/share/svxlink/events.d/

Make a copy of your svxlink.conf

cp /etc/svxlink/svxlink.conf /etc/svxlink/svxlink-orig.conf


Make changes to /etc/svxlink/svxlink.conf
=======================================================

Add SimplexLogicTS

in [GLOBAL] as below line:

LOGICS=SimplexLogic,ReflectorLogic,SimplexLogicTS

and in [ReflectorLink] like the following line:

CONNECT_LOGICS=SimplexLogic:9:SVX,ReflectorLogic,SimplexLogicTS

======================================================

Restart svxlink

systemctl restart svxlink


You can now record your audio:
=======================================================

Open the page on your dashboard:

http://ip_address/audio/

Select the test group, e.g. TG999, using DTMF
code: 91999#

Click the "Click to record 15 sec test audio" button

Speak into the microphone as if you were making a call

The maximum recording time is 15 seconds.

Once the recording is finished, the dashboard page will refresh (the colour indicator of the level meter will appear momentarily) and under the meter you will see the name of the recorded file which
will have the exact last date and time of recording in its name.

You can now listen to the recorded audio by clicking the button player under the name of the audio file.


Look at the indicator on the page, the audio should be set correctly between -15 and 10dB and only single peaks may appear at -10dB

If the recorded audio does not show the recommended levels, run the program amixer and change the microphone input gain settings and do the audio recording procedure again. Repeat this until you get it
recommended audio settings.


==========================


You can also manually record audio with the command:
sudo sh ./var/www/html/audio/audio.sh speak into the microphone as if you were making a call
Recording time maximum 10 seconds. Once you have finished recording, use CTRL+C and you will be able to listen to your recording on the dashboard page
